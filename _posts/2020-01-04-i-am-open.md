title: I am open
---
The beginning of 2020 coincides with the first big jump in my career.

I decided to move from employment at a software product company to self-employment in software development contract work with the folks at [Mutations Ltd.](https://mutations.ltd/) I plan to use this time and experience to broaden my skillset while also balancing more dedicated personal time on a variety of goals, which includes becoming more involved in my local community.

I am open to listen about new opportunities and recruiters who reference this post will have my attention. I would love to apply my skills to improve the following areas that are personally meaningful:
- Clean and renewable energy
  - Generation
  - Networking ("smart grid")
  - Storage
- Efficient transportation
- Sustainable agriculture
- Waste management and recycling
