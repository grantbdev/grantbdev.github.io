title: My favorite RubyConf 2019 talks
---
The best conference I've been to is [RubyConf](https://rubyconf.org/). It's been a couple years since I last went, but I try to keep up with the community and watch most of the talks online.

[You should explore all of this year's talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9R7PUCEXo&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyZDE8nFrKaqkpd-XK4huygU) because there is something for everyone.

The following are my favorites from 2019:
